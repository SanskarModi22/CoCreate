This is a Dart code for a `SocketRepo` class that uses the `socket_io_client` package to connect to a Socket.IO server.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```dart
import 'package:socket_io_client/socket_io_client.dart';
import '../client/socket_client.dart';
```

This code imports the `socket_io_client` package and a custom `SocketClient` class.

```dart
class SocketRepo {
  final _socketClient = SocketClient.instance.socket!;
  Socket get socketClient => _socketClient;
```

This code defines a `SocketRepo` class that has a private `_socketClient` field of type `Socket` from the `socket_io_client` package. The `!` symbol at the end of the line forces the Dart compiler to assume that the `socket` field of the `SocketClient` instance is not `null`.

The class also has a public `socketClient` getter method that returns the `_socketClient` instance.

```dart
  void joinRoom(String documentID) {
    _socketClient.emit('join', documentID);
  }
}
```

Finally, this code defines a `joinRoom` method that takes a `documentID` parameter and emits a `join` event to the server using the `_socketClient` instance. This method is used to join a room identified by the `documentID` on the server.


-------------------------------------------------------

This is a Dart code for a `SocketClient` class that uses the `socket_io_client` package to connect to a Socket.IO server.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```dart
import 'package:socket_io_client/socket_io_client.dart' as io;
import '../constants/host_service.dart';
```

This code imports the `socket_io_client` package as `io` and a custom `host_service.dart` file that contains a `host` constant.

```dart
class SocketClient {
  io.Socket? socket;
  static SocketClient? _instance;
```

This code defines a `SocketClient` class that has a nullable `socket` field of type `io.Socket?` and a private static nullable `_instance` field of type `SocketClient?`.

```dart
  SocketClient._internal() {
    socket = io.io(host, <String, dynamic>{
      'transports': ['websocket'],
      'autoconnect': false,
    });
    socket!.connect();
  }
```

This code defines a private constructor `_internal()` that initializes the `socket` field by creating a new `io.Socket` instance using the `host` constant and some options. The `connect()` method is then called on the `socket` instance to connect to the server.

```dart
  static SocketClient get instance {
    _instance ??= SocketClient._internal();
    return _instance!;
  }
```

This code defines a static getter `instance` that returns the `_instance` instance if it exists or creates a new `SocketClient` instance using the private constructor `_internal()` if it doesn't. This getter ensures that there is only one instance of the `SocketClient` class throughout the application.

Overall, this class provides a singleton `SocketClient` instance that can be used to connect to a Socket.IO server by calling the `socket` field. The `host_service.dart` file contains the server host URL.
